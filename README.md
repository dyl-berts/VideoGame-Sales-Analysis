### ðŸŽ® Video Game Market Analysis: Decades of Gaming Trends

**Project Overview**

This project delves into a historical dataset of video game sales to uncover significant trends and competitive dynamics within the global gaming market. Leveraging Python for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, the goal is to provide a clear understanding of genre popularity shifts and the market share evolution of leading publishers over time.

This analysis is particularly useful for game developers, publishers, and industry enthusiasts looking to identify long-term patterns, understand market dominance, and inform strategic decisions.

**Key Features & Analysis**

Comprehensive Data Loading & Cleaning: Efficient handling of raw sales data, including necessary cleaning and preparation for robust analysis.

Platform Performance Analysis:

Quantifies the overall contribution of each gaming platform to total global sales.

Visualizes the spread and central tendency of individual game sales on different platforms, identifying platforms with consistently high-selling titles versus those with more varied performance.

Highlights the individual blockbuster titles that drove sales on each major platform.

Genre Market Share Evolution:

Identifies the most prominent video game genres.

Visualizes how the global market share of these genres has changed year-over-year using stacked area charts.

Visualizes the spread and central tendency of individual game sales within different genres, identifying genres with consistently high-selling titles versus those with more varied performance.

Reveals emerging trends, declining categories, and consistent performers.

Top 10 Publisher Dominance:

Determines the overall top 10 publishers based on their cumulative global sales across the entire dataset.

Analyzes and visualizes the annual global market share of these industry giants.

Showcases the shifting landscape of publisher influence and concentration.

Regional Market Analysis:

Visualizes the spread and central tendency of individual game sales across different geographical regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Japan, Other), highlighting regional market peculiarities and average sales performance.

Visualizes the total global sales by region using a map, providing a quick visual understanding of dominant markets.

Explores the relationships and dependencies between sales in different regions using a correlation heatmap, identifying which markets tend to move in tandem.

Further visualizes the correlation between highly correlated regions to provide deeper insights into their sales relationships and consistency.

Interactive Visualizations: Utilizes Plotly Express to create interactive charts, allowing users to hover over data points for detailed insights into sales figures and market percentages.

Narrative-Driven Analysis: The project is presented in a Jupyter Notebook, where Markdown cells provide detailed explanations of methodologies, insights, and conclusions for each analytical step, making the entire process transparent and easy to follow.

How to Run the Project Locally
To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/dyl-berts/VideoGame-Sales-Analysis.git
cd VideoGame-Sales-Analysis

Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

    python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install Dependencies:

Bash

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly jupyter

Place Your Data:

Ensure your video game sales .csv file is placed in the project's root directory (or update the file path in the notebook if it's elsewhere).
(If you loaded the CSV into SQLite for the project, mention that here: e.g., "If using SQLite, ensure your your_database_name.db file is present or follow instructions in the notebook to regenerate it from the CSV.")
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

Bash

jupyter notebook
This will open Jupyter in your web browser.

Open and Run the Notebook:
Navigate to the project notebook (e.g., video_game_market_analysis.ipynb) and open it. You can then run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

Key Findings

* **Market Leadership & Longevity:** We identified **Nintendo & Electronic Arts (EA) Games** as the clear market leaders, demonstrating its ability to maintain significant global sales over many years. Its historical performance serves as a benchmark for sustained success.
* **Platform Dominance:** Our analysis highlighted the platforms that consistently drive the highest total sales, along with the varying distribution of individual game sales on each. This provides a clearer picture of market concentration and typical game performance per system.
* **Evolving Genre Landscape:** We observed the sales trends of various genres over time, pinpointing both evergreen categories and those experiencing significant growth or decline. This insight is crucial for aligning game development with current and future player preferences.
* **Genre-Specific Performance Metrics:** Beyond overall trends, our analysis of global sales distribution by genre provided a nuanced view of typical sales (median) and consistency (IQR) within each genre, crucial for understanding inherent risk and reward.
* **Optimized Genre-Platform Pairings:** We identified the top-selling genres for each specific platform, providing highly actionable insights into which game types are most commercially viable on particular systems.
* **Winning Game Formats:** By examining top-selling titles within specific genre-platform combinations, we gained concrete examples of successful game characteristics and market fit, offering valuable lessons for potential new releases.
* **Regional Market Dynamics:** We visualized the overall contribution of North America, Europe, and Japan to global sales, identifying NA as the largest market. Furthermore, we discovered a **strong positive correlation (0.77)** between North American and European sales, suggesting interconnected market behaviors and potentially synchronized release strategies across these two major Western territories.

Future Enhancements

* **Competitor Benchmarking:** A deeper dive into how other major publishers compare in terms of genre focus, platform distribution, and regional strengths.
* **Trend Prediction:** Utilizing time-series forecasting models to predict future sales trends for specific genres or platforms.
* **Audience Demographics:** If data becomes available, integrate demographic information to understand player preferences in more detail.
